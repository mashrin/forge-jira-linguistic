# JIRA Linguistics

This project contains a Forge app written in Javascript that performs Lemmatization, PoS and Parsing for different linguistic analysis in several languages: morphosyntactic analysis, PoS (Part of Speech) tagging, and lemmatization for a JIRA issue description. It can be used for any NLP app for JIRA analysis.
